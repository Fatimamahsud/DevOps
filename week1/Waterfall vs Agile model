The main differences between the Waterfall and Agile models are as follows:

Approach: The Waterfall model follows a sequential approach, where each 
phase of the software development life cycle is completed before moving 
on to the next phase. In contrast, the Agile model follows an iterative 
and incremental approach, where the software is developed in small iterations,
and each iteration involves the planning, design, development, and testing 
of a working software increment.

Flexibility: The Waterfall model is less flexible, as it requires all 
requirements to be defined upfront, and any changes require going back
to the beginning of the development cycle. On the other hand, Agile is
more flexible, as changes can be accommodated throughout the development
process, and each iteration can incorporate feedback from the previous
iteration.

Feedback: In the Waterfall model, feedback is limited, and any changes 
require a formal change request process. In contrast, the Agile model 
emphasizes regular feedback, which allows the development team to make
changes and adjustments throughout the development process.

Delivery: The Waterfall model aims to deliver the final product at 
the end of the development cycle, while Agile aims to deliver a working
software increment after each iteration.

Testing: In the Waterfall model, testing is performed at the end of the
development cycle, while in Agile, testing is an ongoing process and is 
integrated into each iteration.

Overall, Agile is considered more suitable for complex projects with
changing requirements, while the Waterfall model is better suited for
projects with well-defined requirements and a fixed scope.
