Customer-centric approach: DevOps teams should focus on delivering value to the customer by understanding their needs and feedback and incorporating it into the development process.

Agile methodologies: DevOps teams should follow agile methodologies, such as Scrum or Kanban, to promote flexibility, adaptability, and continuous delivery.
