Continuous Integration (CI) is a software development practice in which developers frequently integrate their code changes into a shared repository, such as Git, and run automated tests on the code to detect integration issues as early as possible. The goal of CI is to improve software quality and reduce the risk of integration issues by detecting and fixing problems as quickly as possible.
