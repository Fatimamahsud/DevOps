Cloud computing refers to the delivery of computing services, including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, and analytics, over the internet
("the cloud"). Instead of hosting these resources on-premises, cloud computing enables users to access them on demand from anywhere with an internet connection.

There are several types of cloud computing services, including:

Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): Provides virtualized computing resources, such as servers, storage, and networking, on a pay-per-use basis.

Platform as a Service (PaaS): Provides a platform for developing, testing, and deploying applications, without the need to manage the underlying infrastructure.

Software as a Service (SaaS): Provides access to software applications over the internet, typically on a subscription basis.

There are five essential characteristics of cloud computing that define this technology:

On-demand self-service: Users can easily and quickly provision computing resources, such as servers, storage, and networking, without the need for human intervention.

Broad network access: Cloud services are available over the internet from a wide range of devices, including laptops, smartphones, and tablets.

Resource pooling: Cloud providers consolidate computing resources, such as servers and storage, to create a shared pool of resources that can be allocated dynamically
to users based on demand.

Rapid elasticity: Cloud services can quickly and easily scale up or down in response to changes in demand, enabling organizations to be more agile and responsive.

Measured service: Cloud providers typically charge users for their usage of computing resources on a pay-per-use basis, providing transparency and accountability for 
resource consumption.

Cloud deployment models refer to the different ways in which cloud services can be deployed and made available to users. There are four main cloud deployment models:

Public cloud: In a public cloud deployment model, computing resources are owned and operated by a cloud provider, and made available to customers over the internet
on a pay-per-use basis. Public clouds are generally the most affordable option, and can be used by organizations of all sizes.

Private cloud: In a private cloud deployment model, computing resources are owned and operated by a single organization, either on-premises or in a data center, and
are not shared with other users. Private clouds offer greater security and control, but can be more expensive to set up and maintain.

Hybrid cloud: In a hybrid cloud deployment model, computing resources are spread across a combination of public and private clouds, allowing organizations to take 
advantage of the benefits of both models. Hybrid clouds are often used by organizations that need to store sensitive data on a private cloud, while using a public 
cloud for less sensitive workloads.

Community cloud: In a community cloud deployment model, computing resources are shared by a group of organizations with shared interests or requirements, such as 
a group of healthcare providers or government agencies. Community clouds offer cost savings and greater collaboration between organizations, but require careful
management to ensure data privacy and security.
